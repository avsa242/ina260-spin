# ina260-spin
-------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller 1, P2X8C4M64P/Propeller 2 driver object for the TI INA260 Precision Current and Power monitor IC

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P). Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Salient Features

* I2C connection at up to 400kHz (P1), _TBD_ (P2)
* Read manufacturer ID, die ID
* Read shunt current, bus voltage, calculated power
* Set operation mode (one-shot/triggered, continuous, power-down)
* Set conversion time for voltage and current measurements
* Set measurement averaging samples
* Set interrupt/alert source, threshold, active state (open-collector high/low), latching
* Read flags: conversion ready, power overflowed

## Requirements

P1/SPIN1:
* spin-standard-library
* P1/SPIN1: 1 extra core/cog for the PASM I2C driver

P2/SPIN2:
* p2-spin-standard-library

## Compiler Compatibility

* P1/SPIN1: OpenSpin (tested with 1.00.81)
* P2/SPIN2: FastSpin (tested with 5.0.0)
* ~~BST~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~Propeller Tool~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~PNut~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)

## Limitations

* Very early in development - may malfunction, or outright fail to build
* Doesn't support alternate slave addresses
* Interrupt threshold parameter is currently a word, which isn't very intuitive

## TODO

- [x] Implement methods for reading the three measurements
- [x] Implement methods for configuring the chip
- [x] Implement methods for setting interrupts/alerts
- [ ] Add support for alternate slave addresses
- [ ] Modify the interrupt threshold setting to accept natural values rather than a raw word
